Here's a general overview of how e-commerce website's components interact:
- Users interact with the frontend interface created using HTML and Bootstrap.
- The frontend sends requests to the backend, which is built using PHP. The backend processes these requests, performs necessary actions (such 
as fetching product data or processing orders), and communicates with the MySQL database.
- For the contact form, the frontend sends the form data to Formspree using HTTP requests. Formspree then processes the data and sends it to your designated email address.
